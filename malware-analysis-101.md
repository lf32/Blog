# Malware Analysis 101

Malware is a piece of shit useful to some and not to others. If you think you are a cyber criminal then its a good piece of shit for you. But its also a good piece of shit for those who love to swim in the world of unethical software development for people like me. I am highly interested in studying these cause why not? I find my self placed among the elitest who understand how ethics are being practiced in the internet world which is completely dependent on software.
