# Operating Systems

Well, Am I a privacy advocate? No, but I do have a little knowledge about how and why online privacy is needed. I have tried out a lot of operating systems and their flavours based on Windows and Linux, some how I ended up understading that windows is not efficient in terms of privacy and security. But in the world of linux which exactly do you think fits the best?&#x20;



I came across few operating systems which I want you to know and I do encourage to use&#x20;

1. Tails OS (USB)
2. Whonix (VM)
3. Qubes OS &#x20;
