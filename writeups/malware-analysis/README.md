  I was going through Advanced Malware Analysis. I thought it would be good to
  make some notes while studying the book.

# ðŸ•· Malware Analysis

Malware is a piece of shit to some and not to others. If you think you are a cyber criminal then its a good piece of shit for you. But its also a good piece of shit for those who love to swim in the world of understanding how unethically software is being used and how to prevent it from hurting systems. I am highly interested in studying these cause why not? I find my self placed among the elitest who understand how ethics are being practiced in the internet world which is completely dependent on software.

Lets know what are the step by step level of understanding  malware

* Malware Blue Print
* Malware Research Lab
* Malware Inspection

&#x20;In Malware Blue Print we discuss about different concepts and technologies

* Malware Analysis 101
* Taxonomy
* Deployment
* Protective Mechanisms
* Dependencies

In Malware Research Lab we discuss about how to setup a lab for analyzing different types of malware

* Malware Collection
* Static Analysis Lab
* Dynamic Analysis Lab

In Malware Inspection we get nitty-gritty details of the malware.

* Portable Executable (PE) Files
* Proper Way To Handle Files
* Inspecting Static Malware
* Inspecting Dynamic Malware
* Tools of the Trade

## Malware Analysis != Reverse Engineering

Malware analysis is more about the mastery of different tools, techniques, and processes to extract as much information from malware without disassembling or de-compiling it and to make malware function in a controlled environment for the purpose of monitoring and collecting data that can be used to understand the malwareâ€™s true directive.

> A combination of malware analysis and reverse engineering usually exposes new malware techniques that are otherwise not visible through malware analysis alone

There are 2 Types of Malware Analysis

* Static
* Dynamic

> Static malware is malware at rest. Dynamic malware is malware in motion

In **static analysis** we analyze the malware without executing it. We can use static analysis tools from Windows or Linux to study but researchers prefer to use Windows static Analysis tools. We can use **WINE** on Linux for analyzing the malware, this programme as it acts as a middleman to run windows based programmes.

> Note: WINE is not an Emulator

In **Dynamic Analysis** we analyze the malware by executing it and it offers more in-depth view into Malware's functions because it is collecting information while the malware is executing its functions and directives.

To conduct DMA we need

* Malware Test Environment
* Dynamic Analysis Tools (a.k.a. system monitoring tools)

> A fully implemented malware test environment with the appropriate dynamic analysis tools is also known as a **malware sandbox**.

### Prevention of Malware

It is important to know how the malware gets into a system in-order to prevent spread of malware

> **Infection vector** refers to the technology used by attackers to deliver or deploy malware into a target system. The most common technology used is e-mail

When analyzing malware, there is no need to choose between the two types of static analysis or dynamic analysis. They complement each other and should be done one after the other. If the malware proves to be difficult and static analysis and dynamic analysis yield poor results, **reverse engineering** is done to get to the bottom of what the malware really is.
