# Gentoo Linux: Pros and Cons

I hope you have seen this meme before about linux distributions compared with growing beard compared. As you see Gentoo stands close to Linux from scratch, simply the linux file system.

I have been an linux enthusiast and tinkered with Gentoo Linux for more than a Year. Wiping drives has been my to do job for few months trying out new unix/linux operating systems in the market and Gentoo linux had been on my list to install. It has taught me more about the hardware level connection with software.

Most of the time you would listen some linux user mention [`ITS full of Compilation and Shit!`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. Well it's not true. The only part of its trueness is you will need to compile every package you install on your OS. Though Gentoo.org does provide binaries to install its your choice to decide whether you would like to compile packages or not but trying it out would help you learn how and what packages are necessary to run a good worthy operating system. Luckily if you stick to minimalist software then you dont have to deal with huge compilation times such as spending an entire day to compile a bloated software like Firefox or Chromium. Instead you can just stick to some minimalist software like [surf](https://suckless.org/surf) created by Suckless Devs. Gentoo is known for its flexibility and customization options. It follows a source-based package management system, which allows users to compile software and enables greater optimization and customization for specific hardware and software requirements. This level of control appeals to advanced users who value performance and enjoy fine-tuning their system to their exact needs. However, it requires more technical expertise and can be time-consuming to set up and maintain compared to more user-friendly distributions.

OpenRC, is an init system that provides process management and system initialization functionalities for Gentoo Linux and other distributions. It focuses on simplicity and is not a bloated piece as Systemd. **OpenRC relies on shell scripts for configuration,** making it reliable for those to understand and can modify system startup service management processes.

I prefer highly customizable system and these offer me a high degree of control with flexibility, the only thing that it makes me go mad is their software may require more time to set up and maintain compared to more user-friendly alternatives.
